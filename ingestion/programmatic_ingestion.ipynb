    "# Programmatic ingestion via the REST API\n",
    "\n",
    "The frontend normally drives the ingestion workflow by calling three FastAPI endpoints in sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [`/upload`](../backend/score.py) registers a `Document` node and stores the original file under `backend/merged_files`.\n",
    "2. [`/extract`](../backend/score.py) chunks the text, generates embeddings, writes graph triples, and updates the document status.\n",
    "3. [`/post_processing`](../backend/score.py) materialises optional indices (vector + hybrid search, similarity graph, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you already have a project that has been preprocessed into Markdown files the UI can be bypassed entirely. Run the backend as normal (for example with `uvicorn score:app --reload` from the `backend` directory or through Docker) and then call the helper located in `backend/scripts/bulk_ingest_via_api.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use directly from Python (ideal for notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper exposes an `ingest_project_via_api` function so you can trigger ingestion from Python without touching the command line. This works well at the end of your preprocessing notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from backend.scripts.bulk_ingest_via_api import ingest_project_via_api\n",
    "\n",
    "ingest_project_via_api(\n",
    "    project_name=\"PROJECT_NAME\",\n",
    "    base_url=\"http://localhost:8000\",\n",
    "    uri=\"neo4j://neo4j:7687\",\n",
    "    user=\"neo4j\",\n",
    "    password=\"letmein123\",\n",
    "    database=\"neo4j\",\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All parameters fall back to the same environment variables that the UI relies on (`LLM_GRAPH_BUILDER_BASE_URL`, `NEO4J_URI`, etc.), so you can omit explicit arguments when they are already configured."
