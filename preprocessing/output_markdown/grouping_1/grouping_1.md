1. Background
Modern transportation networks are complex systems with evolving challenges in traffic flow, environmental impact, and infrastructure resilience. To effectively address these issues, city planners and engineers need tools that support informed decision–making, scenario testing, and system optimization without risking real–world consequences. This project focuses on leveraging Data–Driven Digital Twins, which are virtual models of physical systems that continuously update using real–time data. By simulating real–world transportation dynamics, Digital Twins can help expose vulnerabilities, assess environmental impacts, and test mobility scenarios under different conditions. The aim is to improve transportation resilience, efficiency, and sustainability across urban networks.

2. Methods
The project integrates large-scale digital twin modeling with data-driven simulation tools. The team is building an open-source toolkit that incorporates simulation modules, data pipelines, and visual components to accelerate development.
Key efforts include:
- Developing a Digital Twin of the Columbus transportation network.
- Simulating traffic and environmental conditions to analyze the effects of variables like electric vehicle charging behavior.
- Using Digital Twins to test mobility hypotheses and evaluate system performance under stress.
- Enhancing models with adaptive object detection and heterogeneous data fusion for realistic and scalable applications.
- Collaborating with industry and academic partners (for example, HGPU, CMU, HRI–EU) to drive interdisciplinary research and implementation.

3. Findings
Early outcomes demonstrate the potential of Digital Twins to model real-time behavior and guide smarter transportation policies. Highlights include:
- Identification of network vulnerabilities under various mobility scenarios.
- Visualization of traffic dynamics during peak hours, aiding scenario planning.
- Publications and planned patents addressing cooperative vehicle environments and scalable digital modeling.
- Demonstrated collaboration benefits, such as shared insights on EV impacts on traffic and environmental systems.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain. The team continues to tackle issues like data access limitations, model scalability, and balancing accuracy with performance. Addressing these will be crucial for translating research into impactful, real-world applications.
